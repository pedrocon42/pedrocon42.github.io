  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently a junior studying Electrical Engineering at Morgan State University in Baltimore, MD, expecting to graduate in Fall 2027.

    My work will develop a machine learning defense system to predict and counteract unforseen adversial attacks.

    When I‚Äôm not working on research, I enjoy shooting photography, building circuits, and going to explore different places.
