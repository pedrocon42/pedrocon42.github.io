subtitle: Neural Engineering & Assistive Robotics
project_title: "Proactive Defense System for Unforeseen Adversarial Attacks"

problem: |
  Current cyber defense systems are reactive and rely on known attack patterns, leaving networks vulnerable to novel and unforeseen adversarial threats, especially in IoT environments.

approach: |
  The project will implement a meta-learning-based adversarial training model (Meta-Adv) to proactively detect new cyberattacks. The pipeline includes:
  - Training neural networks on benchmark adversarial datasets
  - Meta-training and meta-testing the Meta-Adv model
  - Converting the model from Python to C++ for IoT deployment
  - Evaluating model accuracy and robustness against real-time, unknown attacks

  Tools include Python, C++, and IoT hardware for deployment and testing.

outcome: |
  A functional proactive detection system capable of identifying unforeseen attacks on IoT devices, along with performance evaluation data and a research presentation outlining system design, implementation, and results.
