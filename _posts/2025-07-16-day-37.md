what_i_learned: |
  I continued looking into beginning phase 2 of converting the model to C++. Since my model is stil running, I was hoping I would be able to convert a sample test model using one of my older models. I ran into an error because I had to save the weightsfrom the model and I could not do that without starting to train it again and that would be too much for my computer to handle. But, my model will not be able to finish flly running so I had a group memeber run only 10 epochs and that will be the model we will use to upload to the Iot devices. We also began setting up the devices by hooking them up to a switch on the breadboard, and our Grad student mentor is working on setting up the code for the device at the moment.

  Was not able to run test conversion to C++ without starting to train again. 

reflection: |
  It is coming down to the wire at the moment and I feel somewhat confident we will be abe to present our research, but it is just a matter of our Grad student mentor giving us instructions and our faculty mentor so that way we can work together. THe conversion is a little confusing  so I am wondering how that will go because in the research I was doing, it brought up a lot of more steps than I expected but this week we will be able to tackle that.
