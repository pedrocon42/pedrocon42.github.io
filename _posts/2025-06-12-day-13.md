what_i_learned: |
  We started the day with Cohort connect and it was very fun and very engaging. The taboo game and Jenga helped me connect with more people outside of my group and it was good team-devloping skills. After we learned about Overaleaf and how we are going to use it to write our paper. Coming back from lunch, my group and I continued trying to devleop our models to repliucate the meta-adv model that is demonstrated in the paper. It is a lot of code and concepts to try and understand so it was a little overwhelming, but I am going to try my best to come up with a model and let my code run overnight.

  Debugging is annoying and trying to fix these issues and having them pop up again and again is time consuming.
reflection: |
  Today was a good day because I was able to connect with more people. I was also able to work on my skillset when working with others. Overleaf is very nteresting and a new tool I have never used, it seems very tedious, but I am willing to learn how we will need to use this specific tool for our report. Coding is also very tedious but I am glad I am learning while also tyring to solve real-world problems.
