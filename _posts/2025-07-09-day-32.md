  Yesterday I was not able to have a full model because of constant errors, so today I worked on fixing those errors in order to try and get a full running model. I was able to fixe some of the errors that involved blocks that displayed the progress of the model and had it running displaying the progress how I wanted. Once I fixed that I was able to get results that were actually really good. There were high accuracies all across just for one epoch, and the meta-loss finally started really low. However two of the attacks were almost 100% accuracy, and so that was not a good sign because it meant the attack was not strong enough, hindering the model's overall robustness. I then went in and made the attack overall stronger ad it was able to drop in accuracy, but overall the accuracy is where I want it to be. I also began looking at how we will convert the model once it finished running to convert it to C++.

  Way too high of an accuracy, had to increase the strength of an attack.

  The model is exactly where it needs to be, I am just worrying about how much time and money it will take to fully run and if it will be enough for the models overall robustness. That being said, the model is robust as it is so I feel that we are starting to get closer to closing this project out. I am just tired of having to spend money just to get a running model on GPU. My grad student mentor told me the model looks promising and so we will see how it turns out. The thing is we need a model that finished running and training in order to convert it to C++ and there will be a couple of things to be changed within the code, but we will cross that bridge when we get there.
