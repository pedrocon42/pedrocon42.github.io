what_i_learned: |
  Today I was able to understand the concept of Naive Bayes in machine learning and how it is used to caclulate the probability of whether data belongs to a certain classification based on its features. We did this by devloping a model that took data of whether or not it was safe to play outside that depended on the weather and the temperature. We were able to train the model using a datset of different condtions and it was able to learn and apply that when we gave it a different set of conditions and gave number that indicated whether or not it was ok to play outside. There was a trip up in the dataset where the conditions of the weather and whether or not it was ok to play outside was reversed, so in the datset it had that if it was raining outside and it was cold, it was ok to play outside. This was on purpose in order to see if we would pick up on it. 

  We then did another project that classified wine depending on the features it had. We trained the model with 70 percent of the data and used 30 percent to be able to test its predictions and accuracy. The model was able to predict it accurately. I then did a small little project where the model detected if a message is considered spam or not and it wa svery similar and easier than the first 2 projects.

reflection: |
  I feel a lot more confident conceptualizing how this will apply to our research. The Naive Bayes models we worked on today can translate into our research in the sense of how accurately our model can classify the data into whether or not it is an attack. I also feel more confident in reading and understanding code and how machines can detect and train itself in order to react to new data given to it and how it classifies this given data.
