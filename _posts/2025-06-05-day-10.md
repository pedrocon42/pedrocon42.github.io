what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued working on different machine learning projects. Beforehand, we woud follow a sort of step-by-step process in building the model, but today we built one just by using directions and there were things we had to figure out on our own. We used LLMS to help generate the code. We used functions from the pnadas library to read the dataset, which in this case were CNN articles, and we generated a code that was able to read through the articles and select different words and displayed the data of how many times the words were mentioned in the articles. Then in this model, we used a seperate dataset that had words used in the articles and used that to detect how many times those words were used in articles related to business. 

  After that, we began learning about the Naive Bayes Algorithm which is a supervised probability Algorithm used to predict the probability of data given the features we give the model.

  During the building of the ML, it was very frustrating having to go in and debug even though it seemed like there was nothing wrong with the code, but I took it as a learning experience.

  Overall today was a good way to get actual practice on building machine learning models. I found it interesting how machine learning works when you give it a dataset and use the model to give you informtaton about that data or make predictions. Debugging was annoyting but I enjoyed tryng to solve a problem wthout just giving me the answers, having to actually work through it. We did not go too deep into Naive Bayes, but it seems like the hardest concept to grasp so far, but it also seems like it will be a big part of our main project, so I am excited to work through it.
