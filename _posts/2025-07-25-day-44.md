what_i_learned: |
  We began the day learning about brain computer interface research. It was very interesting especially being able to play around with it in real time. I did not reallize how behind the research on that is all things considered and it may be something I might want to pursue in the future. Coming back to the lab, it seems there will be a "hiccup" because ResNet 56 canot be run on the ESP32, so we have to try to find an alterntive route in uploading the model. We will try to use just one ESP32 and try to convert the ONNX of the model to TensorFlowLite to be able to upload it to the ESP32.

  Starting from Square One with the ESP32. 

reflection: |
  The brain computer interfereance is really interesting, I genuinely wonder what the possibilities can be done with that research. I am annoyed with the fact we spent the last week trying to make the ESP32 work but now we have to go back to the drawing board. I feel like this is something that should have been addressed a long time ago, not when the project is supposed to be finished next week. There was so much potential to improving this research but I just hope we can produce some results.
