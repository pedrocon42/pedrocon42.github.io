what_i_learned: |
  We got some more feedback for our presntation today and were able to run a mock presentation. With the feedback, I was able to expand more on my literature review. I was also able to update some information regarding the data and preliminary findings, more specifically being able to analyze them and explain them in a way everyone can understand. During our mock presentation, we all had some trouble explaining the importance of our project when we are explaining. With some feedback, we were able to work on our oral skills and finding th best way to present our findings.

  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  I feel nervous about presenting, but I also think I can explain the project well enough to keep people interested. I am glad we were given some resources to help us with explaining this project more clearly. It is crazy to look at how much I have learned so far this summer and being able to present my work is an honor. As nervous as I am, I know that we will be fine and we will do our best to run through this model.
