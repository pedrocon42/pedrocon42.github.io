what_i_learned: |
  THe writing workshop taught me a lot on what to say when it comes to the different aspects of my paper and what exactly is being looked for by the audience/reader when it is being presented. Being able to practice and get feedback gave mw some more insight on what I can work on and how I can help my group. When we came back from lunch, our group began discussing who will do which section for the paper and we will try our best to help each other out in anyway we can. 
  One of my groupmates had finished running the 10 epochs, but it ran into an error when it got to the last part, printing the table out, and so I had to go back into my model and fix that. This time, for sake of time, we will only run 10 epochs and right now the accuracy is lower than what I want, but it will have to do. We also helped our grad student mento with trying to figure out possible errors with the ESP32 because since they are 2 devices: one receiving and on sending, the receiver was not being read. We ended up starting the set up again and trying to find any possible error.

  Error printing out results after 10 epochs, and Iot set up failure. 

reflection: |
  I feel more cponfident in writing about the project now. I am also am glad to see my group want to take initiative in working on it together. The model always runs into that error when printing out the table, and it is annoying but I am hoping now it will be able to run with no errors. The ESP32's are a new concept to me and I genuinely wish I knew more about them and how they work, but for right now I have to deal with understanding it conceptually.
