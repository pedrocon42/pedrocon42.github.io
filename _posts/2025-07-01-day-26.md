what_i_learned: |
  Today we went over our project presntation with our faculty mentor. Within the meeting, he gave us a lot of feedback, mainly regarding the wording and what to include in our explanations for the project. For my slides he helped me with making the slides mor aesthetically pleasing but also helped me with explaining what I want to say. I was able to discuess with my group members what can be done with our presentation so far and we gave each other constructive criticism. I also re did the demo video and got it down to 6 minutes and I was able to explain my model thoroughly.

  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  The feedback was very helpful and I feel more confident in the ability to present this Thursday. There is still a couple of things I need to work on within my slides but they are very minor and just need to tweak and prepare myself for a demo presntation we will do tomorrow. The demo video was a lot better today because I knew how to explain the model a lot better and was able to do it in a reasonable amount of time. Another concern I have is having enough time to get through all of the slides, but I think my group mates know how they will manage their time.
