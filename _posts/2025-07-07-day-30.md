what_i_learned: |
  Today I tried running my model again and after the first epoch, I was able to get between 10%-20% accuracy across all clean and compromised images, and I am hoping that is a good sign. It had stopped running due to lack of GPU Units so I purchased more, hoping this time it will be able to run more effeciently. We also met with Dr. Cole to test some of the equipment for his new lab and for some of the equipment this project will ultimately be apart of. There were things such as bots, drones, self driving cars, etc., and it was really cool to see them. He also was able to give us his thoughts on our presentation, he was pleased for the most part but believes there is still some improvement to be made. He also explained how we need to get started on the next phase of converting our model to C++ and uploading it into the devices.

  No blockers.

  To be honest I do not like spending my own money on this project but it needs to be done in order to be able to get the desired results. Testing the equipment was cool because it looks like something that will interest me and I will be working with Dr. Cole on that next semester, so I am looking forward to working on it. The feedback was helpful and makes me put into perspective what I need to work on in terms of my public speaking. The next phase is supposedly the easiest and the way Dr. Cole explained how exactly the device will be able to detect the attack based from the model seemed very interesting and we will most likely end up using my model so I am hoping my model works well enough to be able to convert and then upload.
