what_i_learned: |
  Today I had to restart the 15 epoch training because I had to save the Pytorch version of the model in order to convert it to TensorFlow Lite. This TensorFlow Lite will be able to be uploaded to the ESP32 and be set up using Arduino IDE. Once it finishes running we can get some results. I learned that we might not be able to finish it due to hardware restraints because ESP32 does not have enough memory. We all continued to work on the final presentation and received constructive feedback. 
  
blockers: |
  Having to restart training in otder to convert the model to a small file.  

reflection: |
  I realized today that research is not going to be perfect. There is a lot that can be dne with this project given time and resources and that made me feel better because no one has tried to upload a robust model to an IoT Device, even less, and ESP32. There should be more money and different devices and more time in order to truly have a robust model. I changed a couple of details in my slides since we are changing the overall approach to the project.
