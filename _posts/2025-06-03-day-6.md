what_i_learned: |
  Today we went over the research paper assigned to us. Within this research paper that is essentially the basis of our project, I was able to get a better understanding of how the ML model, called Meta-Adv uses meta-learing and adversarial training in order to detect unforseen or new attacks. It uses large datasets that have images that have different attacks within them and the model, through training, was able to detect these attacks accurately and they used other cyber systems to compare its accuracy and how it was either close or better than those systems in terms of detecting it.

   It was hard to fully read through the paper because of my lack of understanding of these systems and how they work and how it all works together. Maintaining my concentration was definitely my biggest struggle.

reflection: |
  I learned a lot today and it is slowly starting to click how our project will come about. Since a lot of these concepts are new to me, I think it will take some time for me to fully understand. Trying to keep my concentration was a battle but I fought threw and did what I could to kep myself engaged in what I was reading. What helped wa ssor tof thinking of it as a puzzle and how each part of this paper has things that work with each other. Overall though, I have a better understanding of what I will be doing.
