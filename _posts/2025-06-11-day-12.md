what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned abut support vector machines and how it is used as a baseline to seperate data from each other. It involves some math behind it and some visualization of how it seperates the data in a sort of graph like manner, where finds an optimal hyperplane (line) to seperate the observations of the data. We then created 2 models for both Naive Bayes and SVM that used both of them to classify and predict data, one for detecing a type of species, ad the other for business salaries. Then, we began running some more test models for our actual research to try to see who can come up with the best model to reflect what is in the research paper.

  There was some trouple trying to understand SVM, especially dealing with mathematical concepts, but I understand the main idea. 
  
  

reflection: |
  THere is a lot of work that need to be done in terms of understanding how these concepts we have been learning will apply to our reseaerch. I think that we are starting to get the hand of understanding the code we are generating and how to develop it to ge thte results we desire. Ultimately, it will take time, but we work well together in comparing our results. Overall, today we learned concepts and immediately applied them and I a excited to continue devloping models of what they have in the paper.
