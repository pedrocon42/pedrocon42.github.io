what_i_learned: |
  Spent most of the day setting up the ESP32 and we were able to set up a lightweight ML model that had adversarial training on it. However, we were not able to convert the model fully to TensorFlow Lite and it made us not finish the purpose of this model. That kind of tied into the end results for tomorrow's presentation so we were ablt to finally finish the slides. I am happy to have learned what I know now about machine learning and about defense systems.
  
blockers: |
  Model was not able to be uploaded to the ESP32 Device.

reflection: |
  I am frustrated that we could not get the expected results. But that is okay because I was able to takeaway something this summer, I enhanced my coding skills and learned a lot about machine learning in general. I want to learn more and I wish there had been better time management and guidance from my Graduate student mentor and better resources. There was a lot of places where we could have improved on but I am just grateful for the experience.
