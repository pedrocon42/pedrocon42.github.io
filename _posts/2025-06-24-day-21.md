  Today we began the day going over some general information regarding the program and regarding our Mid Summer Presentation. Upon returning to our lab, I began trying to brainstorm how to improve the accuracy and based it off of the baseline model. I noticed how for the training, they used 20% of the CIFAR-10 datset, so I did the same. I was able to see the accuracy of my model to spike up to about 40-60% across clean and adversarial images. I learned that since it is a smaller set, compared to the whole dataset, it become familiar with the same images, but it still keeps the attacks fresh for each training cycle, keeping the attacks unseen when being tested for its accuracy. I also began working on a script for the Demo-Video that is going to be apart of the presentation.

  The model wa sabout to finish the full 400 epochs training and I was about to get the final results, but for whatever reason, it restarted the whole model, so now I have to wait again for the model to finish executing. I wanted to use this model for the demo video with the results so now I have to wait till tomorrow to do the video. 
  
reflection: |
  It was nice to see my results spike up, but I still want to improve the models overall robustness. Training with only a percentage of the dataset is convenient for quick accuracy increase, but I need to get it to where it uses the whole dataset and still have these high accuracy results and improve the models overall functionality and robustness. My Grad-student mentor was able to give some feedback regarding the slides I had worked on and it was very helpful. I was really bummed out about my model, after almost being done training, just restarting out of nowhere so that sucked. But today I learned why my Model had only gotten low results and now the next step is really begin trying to improve the robustness to take on the unseen attacks on the full dataset.
