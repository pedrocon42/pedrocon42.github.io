what_i_learned: |
  Today we met with our faculty mentor again to further discuss how these n]last 2 weeks will be looking like. He expressed concern on the way the ESP32 device will be set up for testing along with the process to convert the trained model to C++. He will be coming in more frequently in these next couple of weeks to check up on our progress but also help us in any way possible. Today I mainly worked on the Methodology section of our paper, which I always found the hardest part to read about any research paper. I did so by reading through other mthodology's and their way of expressing how they go about their research.

  Writers block.

reflection: |
  Our grad student mentor and faculty mentor are not on the same page and that worry's me mainly because of how close we are to the end and I just hope we can finish strong. Because our group is new to these concepts, we agreed that we have learned more, but the method in being taught to us could have been better and there could have been better instruction. I always struggle with writing and expressing what I am thinking about in terms of hard topics, so writing this paper is a little out of my comfort zone. Looking through the other research papers we read gave me a better glimpse of how to word it and also what is important to include.
