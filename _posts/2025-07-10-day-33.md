what_i_learned: |
  The writing workshop was very insightful into what is to be expected when we begin writing our final report. The activities, I felt, were very helpful and it put into perspective what I can work on personally and how I can help my group with writing our final report. I also got my results from my model that I left running overnight and the accuracy was really great across clean and adversarial images, and it only made it to epoch 10. After sharing this with my mentor, he wanted me to tweak soethings using an LLM and so I did and once this model will be able to finish running, I will be able to convert it to C++.

  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Writing has never been my best skill, so I am glad we are having these workshops to really work on my skills beyond those of technical. I wish the workshop was a little more engaging, like I wish it was more activities to really practice with the writing. I am glad my model is finally bringing better results because I really want to move on to the next phase of the research. Having to spend money in order to just train the model can be worrysome, but I am trying to remain calm and recognize its for the better of the project.
