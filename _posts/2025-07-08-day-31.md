what_i_learned: |
  Since I was told we will most likely use my model, I spent most of today tweaking it and trying to get it as exact to the paper as possible. Because of how much training the paper does and how many steps are within each group for the loop, the run time is very large, despite using the A100 GPU. However, as close as it is, now my model is running into errors actually training, or at least display what it is running. I ran it a couple of times and it kept giving me problems, either taking too long or just straight up random errors with its run time. I am close to finishing it up and my Grad student mentor told me it looks good and he will look it oover so I will have to wait to see what he thinks of it.

  Constant errors and lack of display of results of model running. 
  
reflection: |
  It was really annoying for it to not display any signs of life. I understand the amount of training it needs will need a lot of time, but for it to not display what step it is on and just still run was very tedious because I had to find where exactly I had to fix. The good thing is for when we transfer the model to C++ and then upload it to the Iot devices, it will be a lot quicker because the training has already been done, so the model will just need to be able to detect its attacks. All this to day I am almost ready to go to the next phase, but the project needing a lot of GPU in order to function as desired can be worrysome.
