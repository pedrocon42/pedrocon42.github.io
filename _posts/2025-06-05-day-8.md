what_i_learned: |
  Today we began the day touring the school with all the groups. In this experience I was able to connect with different people and get to know multiple different backgrounds and here about their different interests. After lunch, I met with my group and we discuess our general understanding of the paper we read and where do we go from here. Since all of us are still learning the basics of code, we asked an LLM of our choice to generate the code of what they did in the paper, but in a smaller version so our computer could run it. We essentially used a dataset and then used one attack method that the machine had not detected, and trained it so that it can detect it. My code had 5 epochs with 10 tasks per epoch. Mine began running and it worked first try but once all of the epochs finished, it gave me an error and it was because certain lines did not work because I did not have certain libraries installed so that it can run more efficiently.

  The code did not run successfully even tho it was training using the datasets because of code error and since it was made in a way a regular comoputer can run.
  

reflection: |
  The day was way too hot to be touring the whole school. I did not think we were going to walk all that but it is what it is, I enjoyed getting to talk to people and getting to know some of their interests. The amount of coding knowledge needed for this project seems a little overwhelming. Looking at the code my LLM generated was very hard to fully grasp, but I am beginning to understand the general concept. Running into the error annoyed me because the code had been running for about an hour and a half to 2 hours and it was outputting results from the epochs and I was really looking forward to see how the results would compare to what the paper got. Now I have a better idea of what I am getting myself into in regards to how much coding I will need to know and understand though.
