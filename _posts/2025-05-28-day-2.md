what_i_learned: |
  Today we were able to speak with our Faculty and Graduate student mentor in reference to our project and be able to discuss what needs to be done in the coming weeks. 

  We continued what we started yesterday in Github in regards to our website and we learned how to add to our different sections of the website, such as our "ABout Me" and how to update our daily blog reports. 
  
  We also received our results for the python diagnostic and were able to learn some of the basics of the python programming language. This includes what python, data types, and operations within the python programming language. We played Kahoot and actually wrote some code so that we were able to fully grasp the concepts along with applying what we learned.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today served as a good refresher for python. I have already learned some python but it served as a reminder of certain things I had forgotten about and even learned about some different mathematical operations that I did not know of before today. Overall it was very productive because I was able to learn more about my project and learn about things I will need for my project, such as python.
