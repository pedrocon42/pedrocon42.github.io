what_i_learned: |
  Today I came back to see the results from the code I left running overnight. The results were not what I was expecting because my model was only able to accurately detect 10% of all the datasets, clean data and cyber attacks, accurately. I then went back to the drawing board to try again and I did that by increasing the amount of sets from the dataset used for training to improve its ability to learn in order to detect these unforeseen attacks. Within this implementation I ran into multiple errors within the code itself that involved issues with certain calls in the code that just did not match as it needed to. After all of those trials, I finally got a code running and it should take a much longer time to fully run before I see the results. We also met with Dr. Cole to discuss our current progress and what to expect within the coming weeks. 
  
blockers: |
  Running into the call errors confused me because it all made sense but I was able to overcome and just have th emodel run more smoothly. The run time is also very annoying but that is how it is supposed to be and I know it won't be exactly the same as the paper. 
  
reflection: |
  I was able to get a feel for how this trial and error cycle will feel and able to overcome errors to improve my model. I need to gain a better understanding of my model on how it works in order to truly be able to present my teams progress. Some of the concepts ar estill new, but being able to see the model run in real time and be able to analyze its accuracy helps in gaining insight on these ML concepts, espectially how they take these datsets and train.
