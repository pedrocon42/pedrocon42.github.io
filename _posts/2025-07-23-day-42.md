what_i_learned: |
  We were able to go over our roles in terms of the final presentation using the copy that was given to us. We all began working on our slides and continued editing our project elevator pitch. I also worked on and shot one last clip for the video and now all that is left is to do a voiceover the clips. I was also able to discuss with my grad student mentor regarding the issues with setting up the ESP32. Since we are setting it up similarly to a previous project we have been trying to go that route but the receiever ESP32 is still not working. 
  
blockers: |
  No progress on ESP32. 

reflection: |
  Today was a very light day considering we just continued working on our deliverables. I am glad we got a good start on it and have made significant progress this week so next weekwe can just focus on finishing up some final details. I would like to finish Phase three but the set up with the ESP32 devices is difficult and I would have hoped that we got some guidance on how we can help set it up but our grad student mentor is trying to find his own way. In the bgeinning he made it seem like this part of the project would be the easiest so that is what I was hoping for so I am hoping we can get it done this week so we can finish up our findings for our deliverables.
