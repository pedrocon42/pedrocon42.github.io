what_i_learned: |
  Today we used different AI chatbots, such as Grok, Claude, Copilot, etc., in order to analyze the research paper we were given and compare the results on how it breaks down the concepts we asked it about. From this, I was able to ask about the method for developing the Meta Adv model used in the paper in order to not only detect unforseen adversarial attacks, but also defend against them. After this, we began building our first machine learning model using what is called the "Hello, World" of machine learning in Python. We were able to succesfully load a dataset into our code, and then from there we were able to split the dataset and have the model predict the rest of the unseen data. We tested different algorithms and chose the most accurate one and we got the results we expected.

reflection: |
  There was a lot to unpack when analyzing the paper, but it gave me a better understanding of which LLM can break things down for me in a way I can understand. I feel like going into the research now, I know how to ask and use this in my research in a way for me to understand. Doing the machine learning simple project was also helpful because I can see how the model acts when it trains and ests data. What was hard for me was to understand how that works but now I can see how the machine learning is working within itself and uses the dataset. Our project will use large datasets in order to train the model to detec and defend against new adversarial attacks, so this was a good starter for this concep within our research.
