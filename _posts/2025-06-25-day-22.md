  Today, I came to see how my model that was left running overnight was doing and it did not finish and stopped at 220 epochs unfortunately. I went to run it again and apparently with Colab Pro, I can only utilize the GPU after a certain amount of times using it. I spent most of the day trying to work around it and find other sources to utilize GPU to train this heavy model but it did not work at all. I then had to switch the model from using GPU to CPU. Luckily, the baseline is set up for CPU use, and so I was thinking about how I can run this model in order to see what can be changed. Since the baseline only uses 20% of the dataset for training, I wanted to see if it would be able to run with the whole dataset. That is what I have currently running so I will leave it here running and see the results tomorrow. Within the model, it has it set up where the amout of training batches is directly related to the amount of images from the dataset being used. Since I am doing the whole dataset, it will be somewhere aroun 700 batches per epoch, with the model only running 20 epochs for now.

  The GPU runs a lot faster than CPU so it is unfortunate that I have to use CPU but I will try to make it work to still get promising results.

  Given that the CPU runs very slow, I want to see how I can work around it and still get better accuracy. One of my other group members got Colab Pro recently so maybe we will be able to use his model in order to get more promising results and more accurate results. The model needs a lot of training so we will see how as a group we will overcome this for our final end result becaus as of right now, none of our devices can handle a model of that magnitude. The CPU can only handle so much, so we will see how this plays out.
