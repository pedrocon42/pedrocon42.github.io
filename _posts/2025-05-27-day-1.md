what_i_learned: |
  I learned the basics of Git and Github and how they work and how it will be applied over the course of this internship. I was also able to learn about the different people apart of this internship and it was very insightful, along with meeting the people I will be working with in my group. We played Bingo to get to know each other and I found that really fun and we also played Jeopardy for Git and Github and that was also very fun and very competitive. 

blockers: |
  No blockers. 
  
reflection: |
  I enjoyed learning about Git and Github, when we played jeopardy I felt like I was actually able to understand it better. Also being able to work with others and get t know them was really fun. I am looking forward to see how we will use this down the line.
