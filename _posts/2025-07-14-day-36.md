what_i_learned: |
  In the morning, we were able to learn aout our personlity type and VARK learning preference. I found out I am an INFP personality type and my learning type is Multimodal (AK). It was interesting how accurate this was about me. I was also able to learn about my group's, and the rest of the cohort's learning preference and their personality type. Coming back from lunch, we met with our faculty mentor and discussed what the plan for the rest of the internship will look like. We will wait till my model finishes running and then test it in order to convert it to C++. We will need to speed up the process a bit because we will also need to get the paper done along with the presentation.

  No blockers. 

reflection: |
  The morning meeting was interesting to do because I was able to learn about myself and how my type of personality and learning type can help our group. I feel like this would have been better to do at the beginning of the internship. The meeting with our faculty mentor worried me a bit considering how much time we have left and we still do not have a fully ran model because of the amount of training it requires. I might end up changing it a bit to get a fully ran model.
