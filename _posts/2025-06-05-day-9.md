what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued working on the smaller model from the research paper from yesterday. Since I did not get the chance to run the code with the fixed version yesterday, and it ran successfully. In comparison to the accuracy they got in the research paper, the percentage of correctly identified images and attacks were drastically off, but that was expected, consdering it is a smaller model. After that, we began looking at some foundational cncepts of machine learning, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforced machine learning and how they interact with the data we feed into it. We ran through some practice projects where we took our very first machine learning project and then changed the algorithm. Then after, we ran through a presentation about Natural Language Processsing that had a large dataset that was about online news group posts and it taught us how to access the data and how the machine categorizes the data and essentially learns within itself.

reflection: |
  I feel like today laid the foundation for machine learning and it gave me a sense for how the machine learns to do what you want it to do and how you can train it. I found it interesting how much programming is involved into this type of machine learning and it taught me different commands to access the data and get a visualization of the data. This also showed me how the data categorizes within the machine and how you can play around with the data and see how th emachine learns to display and explore the data. Since this ws something simple like words, I enjoyed it, but I feel like it will get harder when it involves some heavy math. Also the video we recorded today came out good and I felt like it was a good bonding exercise for my group.
