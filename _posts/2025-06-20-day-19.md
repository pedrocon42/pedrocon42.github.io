what_i_learned: |
  Today I was able to generate a model that combined the baseline model that was given to use and my orignial model in order to try and come up with my own model. The results are somewhat improving but not exactly where I want it to be so I want to replicate the learning rate and the hyper-parameters from the baseline and put it in my model. I also worked on a mini-presentation for my professor as a way to prepare for the Mid-Summer presentation. During my presentation I was able to get tips in order to improve my public speaking skills and explain my project in a better way. We also worked on our weekly video slides.

  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today was very productive overall, I am happy to see improvements overall even if they are small. Having a baseline helps a lot because I can see where I can improve from and compare results. Working on the presentation was engaging and I feel like I was able to test my knowledge and be able to explain it better. The feedback was very crucial and it was very helpful. I feel more confident in my ability to explain the project and I know now what to look for when coming up with the slides.
