what_i_learned: |
  I had to restart the training because it stopped running after 14 epochs. However, we will try to run 5 epochs and it is almost done, and this time save it via google drive. Once it saves, it should be able to upload for testing on the ESP32. We also met with our faculty mentor and received feedback for our slides and our paper. We then continued making adjustments and we will finish up any final details tomorrow.

  Having to restart training because it did not save as I hoped it would. 

reflection: |
  At this point, I understand the results and accuracy will not be the best, but I know that we are the first to try and upload this mEta-Adv to a device. Research is not always perfect and it is important to understand that. I did want this to go better and I did not expect it to go this way but it is what it is. I hope we can be able to produce some genuine results.
