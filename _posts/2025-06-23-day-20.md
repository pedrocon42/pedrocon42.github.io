what_i_learned: |
  Today we began working on our presentation for Friday. We were able to assign slides to each person and have a discussion on how our presentation will flow. As far as the Meta-Adv model, I was able to try and improve my accuracy trying to change th learning rate from cosine decay to a constant learning rate, as it is in the baseline. I also kept the attacks to the attacks that are in the baseline. So far, the results are better all across, but its still lower than what I need them to be. The current model is perhaps the beginning of the final model and we'll see where eles I can improve upon from here.

  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  I feel very ready to present the project. It will be a little scary at first especially infront of a lot of people, but I am glad we have this weekto prepare. Also, with the critique I got from my Professor mentor and the High School counselor, I feel like I am more prepared and I took that into consideration when working on my slides. With my current Mmodel, I took some critcism from my grad student mentor and applied them to the model and really hoping the results are better. The low accuracy is a little annoying but I am glad it is a problem that I have to work around myself to see where I can improve upon.
