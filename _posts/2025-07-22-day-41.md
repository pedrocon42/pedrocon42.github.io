what_i_learned: |
  I was able to receive some feedback in regards to the section I wrote for the methodology for our project. I was able to go back and fix some errors and review the rest of the paper. We discussed as a group how we can improve the writing and we were helping each other out with using Overleaf. We also began recording clips that we are going to use for our elevator pitch. We have sort of a skit format where we will demonstrate how are model is proactive against new attacks. We have not finished but we are in the process of editing it at the moment. We have not finished the project aspect due to hardware issues and that is out of our control so we will see where we are with the last part of the project tomorrow.

  No blockers. 

reflection: |
  The feedback was very helpful because as mentioned before, I am not the best writer. It was cool to brainstorm ideas for our elevator pitch today as well because there were a lot of different ideas. It was also fun to shoot the videos and I am excited to see the final product when we finish. It is annoying we are waiting this long to finish the project and get actual results.
