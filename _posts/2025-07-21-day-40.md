what_i_learned: |
  In the morning we had a workshop for Overleaf, which showed us how to write our title, create sections, put our names, and the overall accessibility Overleaf offers. I was able to continue writing up the model evaluation section for the methodology. I also was able to complete the technical approach for the methodology. Speaking further with the Grad student mentor, I learned that we may not convert to C++, due to a conversation he had with our faculty mentor, but for the time being I will raise the epochs to 15 for a little better accuracy.

  No blockers. 

reflection: |
  Overleaf is a little confusing, so I am having to rely on outside sources, along with help from my groupmates on how to use it. I am glad we are getting the overall first part of our paper done, this will save us a lot of time so we can just go over and revise and spend time working on the presentation. I am also glad that our grad student mentor and faculty mentor finally spoke and communicated on where to go from here. Although I will say, I was hoping for us to convert our model to C++ because it would be faster for the ESP32, but we will see how my model's accuracies will be once it finishes by tomorrow morning.
