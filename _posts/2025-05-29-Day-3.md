what_i_learned: |
  We started out the day learning about computer vison and how computers recognize objects and identifying them through machine learning ad information the user gives the computer. We did this using TeachableMachine. We also used code throguhh CoLab to manually go in and have the computer detect these objects.
  My Group was able to complete the online escape room and we worked together in order to find different clues and it served as a good bonding exercise for us.
  Today in our Python course, we learned about type casting, variables, and user inputs. We worked through a couple of problems that involved using what we learned such as storing data as variable sand being able to output data using equations and user inputs.

reflection: |
  Today was very productive becsause computer vision was a concept that I had somewhat heard about but it wa svery interesting to actually go and leanr and practice myself on how it works. The escape room exercise allowed my group to bod and allowed us to work together and I think it was a good reflection on how we will work with each other in our upcoming research. The Python course today served as good practice to apply these basic concepts and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.
