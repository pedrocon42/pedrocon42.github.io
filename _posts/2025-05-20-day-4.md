what_i_learned: |
 I learned a lot about conditional statements in Python at the beginning of the day and was able to use them in different real-world examples. After we were able to learn about generative AI and LLMS and how Ai really works and the history of AI. We also worked within our project group and with the whole group to determine whether or not certain images were AI. 

blockers: |
  My wifi went out while we were doing the Python project so I was not able to complete that and that frustrated me a bit but I was able to get it working and everything ran smoothly from there. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was very fun and proactive and I feel like I learned the most in terms of new information that I did not know about and I was able to apply more critical thinking today.
