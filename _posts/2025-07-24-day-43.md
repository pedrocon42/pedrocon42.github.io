what_i_learned: |
  I learned the main issue happening with the ESP32 was with what it was outputting when the sender was getting ready to send the adversarial attack to the receiver. The output would be symbols sort of represetning the malware, but we had to go through and check the Arduino IDE and look at the dropbox of outputs until the output was in plain english as we expected. Now there is still an issue with the receiver but we will continue working through that tomorrow, but it is essentially done. All that is left is to upload the Meta-Adv model, and collect accuracies. Once we have that, we can finish our deliverables. I also continued woring on the methodology for the Data Collection slide and there I explained how the model will be tested on the devices.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I am happy to see progress for our final results. We also discussed further our deliverables and finished the video so I am glad to see us finally wrapping up. I am glad to see we are all pulling our weight to get this project done before the last day. It does worry ,e if we will be able to test it on the devices but I want to stay optimistic that we will pull through.
