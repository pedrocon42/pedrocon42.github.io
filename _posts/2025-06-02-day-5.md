what_i_learned: |
  Today we started the day off with introductions from all the faculty and staff, as well as the students. We began by speaking a lot about the research being done in AI/ML and how it differs from regular research being done. The difference is that AI/ML has to learn how to make it do what we want by giving it the information we want to give it, this uses independent and dependent variables. There was also a collaboration activity for each group where we had to build something with sphaghetti noodles and on the top there would be a marshmallow and whoever had the marshmallow the highest would win.

  After lunch, we went to our lab to discuss what exactly we will be doing as apart of our research. We began discussing what exactly cybersecuity is and how our project's objective is how to be proactive against syber attacks using machine-learning. We discussed the research paper we will be basing our research on and how exactly we will apply it to our research. We will apply how they came to their conclussion and run actual simmulations using Python and if time allows, C++. We began reading the paper and are going to be reading it for the next couple of days to truly understand it and be prepared to have questions for our meeting with Dr. Cole on Thursday.

  It was difficult to wrap my head around how exactly it works because I understand it theoretically but I need more practice with programming so I am very curious to how it will come out once we begin programming.
  

reflection: |
  Overall, it was a very productive day because I was able to collaborate and bond with my group and also able to get a better sense of what we will be doing fo our research. I feel like even though it will take time, I am excited to be able to learn something new. I feel like with these new topics of cybersecurity and ML under my belt, I will be able to apply how to truly cirtically think into my future endeavors.
