what_i_learned: |
  Today we did a team building activity where we had to rank the necessity of certain items if we were lost at sea. We also practiced a 30 second pitch of our project without using words in our project name. This allowed us to meet the new member our group, the teacher. We were able to meet him and learn a little bit about him and we also were able to introduce ourselves and let him know a bit about our project. After lunch, I bcontinued trying to debug my new model for Meta-Adv and it was just a lot of errors, mainly with certain functions within all the libraries that had to be imported so it was just constant errors. Afterwards, our graduate mentor, Olayinka, gave us a baseline model for Meta-Adv and our goal is to run it and then try and fix the parameters for better results.

  Constant debugging and installing of libraries was really annoying, and also mixed with long run times for this new version of the code. 
  
reflection: |
  I feltl ike today was chill, it is always nice to have a new member toour group. He seems like a very genuine and charasmatic guy so I think he will get along with us. Trying to improve my previous model to get better results gets annoying when it does not even want to run. I even just told my LLM to start again from square one and clarify clearly what I want and where we could go from here. Now that we have a baseline model for Meta-Adv, I think I will be able to take time to go through and see what can be changed to get the best results.
