what_i_learned: |
  Today I continued to rerun my model, it will take some time so we will see the results eventually. I continued my progress on the slides for our presntation. I was able to recive some feedback and changed the slide I was working on to be more aesthetically pleasing and more creative. I was able to use Napkin AI to create a sort of diagram for my slide. I was in charge of the demo cideo so I did that today as well. I understand the project well enough to explain it conceptually, but going through the model was a bit of a challeneg because I have always sturggled with explaining difficult concepts. I took the video over so many times, but I was able to finally get it down to 8 minutes and 37 seconds. I think I will redo it and break it down even simpler tomorrow. 
  
blockers: |
  Nervousness making the video and multiple tries.
  
reflection: |
  The video was very frustrating because I kept messing up and overthinking it. Again, I can explain it conceptually but some of these fundamentals are new to me so I would confuse myelf recoring it. Using Native AI was also really helpful because our slides went from just words to neat diagrams. I purches more compute units from Colab to run the model, but I think it won't be enough so we will see what the accuracy will be when I come back but its annoying that the model needs this much power just to run.
